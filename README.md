D&amp;D (Pathfinder) Character Sheets in Tiddlywiki

These are Pathfinder characters in TiddlyWiki (TW5).  
One design goal was the use as much of the TW5 functionality as possible without pluggins or reliance on JavaScript modules.  
Some JS is required because dynamic tiddler title names in TW5 are very difficult, but possible.  
Does use the math_js pluggin.  It's used sparingly because it really bloats the tiddler code, but helpful in situations 
where a small, simple computation is desired.  For larger computations, JS functions are easier and cleaner.
